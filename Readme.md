# Bytetrack

## Description

**ByteTrack** is a C# module designed to track and record runtime information (e.g., states, events, timings, process data, or basic metrics). Its goal is to provide traceability of what happens inside the system, making it easier to debug, analyze, and validate the overall workflow.

## Current Status (“Dirty” ByteTrack)

At the moment, this is a **“dirty” ByteTrack**: it’s not optimized and is implemented in a straightforward way just to work for now. It serves as an initial functional baseline, with the intention to refactor and optimize it later (performance, memory usage, structure, and code cleanliness).
